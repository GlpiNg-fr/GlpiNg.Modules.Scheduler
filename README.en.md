## Contents

- Deployment tasks
- Network tasks
- Wake-on-LAN tasks
- Automatic actions (`ICronTask`) run on the Cron module's tick, with no background loop of their own

## Usage

This repository is a submodule of [GlpiNg](https://github.com/GlpiNg-fr/GlpiNg), under
`src/GlpiNg.Modules.Scheduler`. It does not build on its own: it references `GlpiNg.Modules.Abstractions`, `GlpiNg.Modules.Deployment` by relative path.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/GlpiNg-fr/GlpiNg.git
```

The host registers it with `services.AddSchedulerModule()` (see `Program.cs`).
